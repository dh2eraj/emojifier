Emojifier is the Android application which uses ML kit and classification. I takes the picture from the User's mobile phone and based on his/her expression, run the ML algorithms to get to know about the facial expressions of all the faces in an image and then places the appropriate emoji on each face. It also allows you to save and share the new emojified image.
